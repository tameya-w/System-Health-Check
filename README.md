# System Health Check using PowerShell

## Project Summary
This project is a **PowerShell script** that checks the system's health by monitoring uptime, CPU & RAM usage, disk space, and network connectivity. The script logs the results into a text file for easy reference.

## Features & Why They Matter
âœ… **Checks System Uptime** â€“ Shows how long your computer has been running since the last restart. This helps identify if a system has been running too long without a restart, which can cause slowdowns or crashes.  
âœ… **Monitors CPU & RAM Usage** â€“ Tracks how much processing power and memory your system is using. High CPU or memory usage can indicate performance issues, potential system overload, or a need for upgrades.  
âœ… **Reports Disk Space Availability** â€“ Checks how much free space is left on your drives. Running low on disk space can slow down a computer, cause errors, and prevent software from working properly.  
âœ… **Tests Network Connectivity** â€“ Pings a website to confirm if your internet is working. This helps quickly diagnose if internet issues are related to the computer or the network itself.  
âœ… **Generates a Log File** â€“ Saves all the system health details in a text file for easy reference. This is useful for troubleshooting recurring issues or tracking performance trends over time.  

Monitoring these metrics helps **prevent problems before they become major issues** and ensures your system runs efficiently!
